  # We perform one release build for each wheel that we generate, i.e. one per architecture.
  # We use CIBW_ARCHS in download_wgpu_native.py to detect what binary is needed.
  # If https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/issues/944 gets implemented, we can build more wheels per build.
  # Some builds can be properly tested, some cannot.
