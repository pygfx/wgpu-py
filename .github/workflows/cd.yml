# Github Actions script to produce binary wheels.
#
# We perform one build for each wheel that we generate, i.e. one per architecture.
# In download_wgpu_native.py, we detect CIBW_PLATFORM and CIBW_ARCHS to determine
# the required binary from wgpu-native.
#
# If https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/issues/944 gets implemented, we can build more wheels per build.
#
# Also includes the sdist build that does not include a binary.
