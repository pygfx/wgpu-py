# wgpu-py

Next generation GPU API for Python


## Introduction

In short, this is a Python lib wrapping the Rust wgpu lib and exposing
it with a Pythonic API similar to WebGPU.

The OpenGL API is old and showing it's cracks. New API's like Vulkan,
Metal and DX12 provide a modern way to control the GPU, but these API's
are too low-level for general use. The WebGPU API follows the same concepts, but with
a simpler (higher level) spelling. The Python `wgpu` library brings the
WebGPU API to Python. Based on [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu).


## Status

*This is experimental, work in progress, you probably don't want to use this just yet!*

* We have a few working examples!
* This currently only works on Windows.
* We don't yet package the wgpu lib; you have to bring it along yourself for now.
* We have not fully implemented the API yet.
* The API may change. We're still figuring out what works best.
* The API may change more. Until WebGPU settles as a standard, its specification
  may change, and with that our API will probably too.

Web support: we are considering future support for compiling (Python)
visualizations to the web via PScript and Flexx. We try to keep that
option open as long as it does not get in the way too much. No promises.


## Installation

```
pip install wgpu
```

This library does not have any dependencies on other Python libraries.
Though if you want to render to the screen you need a GUI toolkit.
Currently supported are `PySide2`, `PyQt5`, `glfw`.

This library will eventually include the required Rust library, but for
now, you have to bring it yourself. Tell where it is by setting the
environment variable `WGPU_LIB_PATH`.


## Usage

The full API is accessable via the main namespace:
```py
import wgpu
```

But to use it, you need to initialize the library first. You can provide
configuration overloads here, such as the choice of backend (default backend is
Rust, ie: `backend='rs'`):

```py
wgpu.init()
```

To give an idea of what this API looks like, here's the API code from the triangle example:
```py
# ... code to create shaders and GUI are omitted for brevity

import wgpu
wgpu.init()

async def main(canvas):

    adapter = await wgpu.requestAdapter(powerPreference="high-performance")
    device = await adapter.requestDevice(extensions=[], limits=wgpu.GPULimits())

    vshader = device.createShaderModule(code=vertex_shader.to_bytes())
    fshader = device.createShaderModule(code=fragment_shader.to_bytes())

    bind_group_layout = device.createBindGroupLayout(bindings=[])  # zero bindings
    bind_group = device.createBindGroup(layout=bind_group_layout, bindings=[])

    pipeline_layout = device.createPipelineLayout(bindGroupLayouts=[bind_group_layout])

    render_pipeline = device.createRenderPipeline(
        layout=pipeline_layout,
        vertexStage={"module": vshader, "entryPoint": "main"},
        fragmentStage={"module": fshader, "entryPoint": "main"},
        primitiveTopology=wgpu.PrimitiveTopology.triangle_list,

        sampleCount=1,
        sampleMask=0xFFFFFFFF,
        alphaToCoverageEnabled=False,
    )

    swap_chain = canvas.configureSwapChain(
        device, wgpu.TextureFormat.bgra8unorm_srgb, wgpu.TextureUsage.OUTPUT_ATTACHMENT
    )

    def drawFrame():
        current_texture_view = swap_chain.getCurrentTextureView()
        command_encoder = device.createCommandEncoder()

        render_pass = command_encoder.beginRenderPass(
            colorAttachments=[
                {
                    "attachment": current_texture_view,

                    "storeOp": wgpu.StoreOp.store,
                }
            ],
            depthStencilAttachment=None,
        )

        render_pass.setPipeline(render_pipeline)
        render_pass.setBindGroup(
            0, bind_group, [], 0, 999999
        )  # last 2 elements not used
        render_pass.draw(3, 1, 0, 0)
        render_pass.endPass()
        device.defaultQueue.submit([command_encoder.finish()])

    canvas.setDrawFunction(drawFrame)
```
