## Introduction

In short, this is a Python lib wrapping [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)
and exposing it with a Pythonic API similar to the [WebGPU spec](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/).

The OpenGL API is old and showing it's cracks. New API's like Vulkan,
Metal and DX12 provide a modern way to control the GPU, but these API's
are too low-level for general use. The WebGPU API follows the same concepts, but with
a simpler (higher level) spelling. The Python `wgpu` library brings the
WebGPU API to Python.

To get an idea of what this API looks like have a look at [triangle.py](https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py/blob/main/examples/triangle.py) and the other [examples](https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py/blob/main/examples/).


## Status

*The wgpu-API has not settled yet, use with care!*

* Coverage of the WebGPU spec is nearly complete.
* Test coverage of the API is 100%.
* Support for Windows, Linux, and MacOS (Intel and M1).
* Until WebGPU settles as a standard, its specification
  may change, and with that our API will probably too. Check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) when you upgrade!


## Installation

```
pip install wgpu
```

The wheels include the prebuilt binaries. If you want to use
a custom build instead, you can set the environment variable `WGPU_LIB_PATH`.
You probably also want to install `glwf` (for desktop) and/or `jupyter_rfb` (for Jupyter).


## Platform requirements

Under the hood, `wgpu` runs on Vulkan, Metal, or DX12. The wgpu-backend is selected automatically, but can be overridden by setting the `WGPU_BACKEND_TYPE` environment variable to "Vulkan", "Metal", "D3D12", "D3D11", or "OpenGL".

On Windows 10+, things should just work. On older Windows versions you
may need to install the Vulkan drivers. You may want to force "Vulkan" while "D3D12" is less mature.

On Linux, it's advisable to install the proprietary drivers of your GPU
(if you have a dedicated GPU). You may need to `apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers`.
Wayland currently only works with the GLFW canvas (and is unstable).

On MacOS you need at least 10.13 (High Sierra) to have Vulkan support.


## Usage

Also see the [online documentation](https://wgpu-py.readthedocs.io).

The full API is accessable via the main namespace:
```py
import wgpu
```

But to use it, you need to select a backend first. You do this by importing it.
There is currently only one backend:
```py
import wgpu.backend.rs
```

To render to the screen you can use a variety of GUI toolkits:

```py
# The auto backend selects either the glfw, qt or jupyter backend
from wgpu.gui.auto import WgpuCanvas, run, call_later

# Visualizations can be embedded as a widget in a Qt application.
# Import PySide6, PyQt6, PySide2 or PyQt5 before running the line below.
# The code will detect and use the library that is imported.
from wgpu.gui.qt import WgpuCanvas

# Visualizations can be embedded as a widget in a wx application.
from wgpu.gui.wx import WgpuCanvas
```

Some functions in the original `wgpu-native` API are async. In the Python API,
the default functions are all sync (blocking), making things easy for general use.
Async versions of these functions are available, so wgpu can also work
well with Asyncio or Trio.

## Developers

* Clone the repo.
* Install devtools using `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt` (you can replace `pip` with `pipenv` to install to a virtualenv).
* Install wgpu-py in editable mode by running `pip install -e .`, this will also install runtime dependencies as needed.
* Run `python download-wgpu-native.py` to download the upstream wgpu-native binaries.
  * Or alternatively point the `WGPU_LIB_PATH` environment variable to a custom build.
* Use `black .` to apply autoformatting.
* Use `flake8 .` to check for flake errors.
* Use `pytest .` to run the tests.
* Use `pip wheel --no-deps .` to build a wheel.


### Changing the upstream wgpu-native version

* Use the optional arguments to `python download-wgpu-native.py --help` to download a different version of the upstream wgpu-native binaries.
* The file `wgpu/resources/wgpu_native-version` will be updated by the script to track which version we depend upon.

### Example screenshot verification

Include the comment `# test_example = true` in an example to have pytest run it as part of the test suite.

To support testing an example, ensure the following requirements are met:

* The `WgpuCanvas` class is imported from the `wgpu.gui.auto` module.
* The `canvas` instance is exposed as a global in the module.

By default the test will simply verify that the example can be executed without an error, and that an
image can be rendered using the canvas.

If a screenshot for the example is available in the `examples/screenshots` folder, the test will additionally
verify that the rendered image matches the screenshot.

You can (re)generate the reference screenshot like so: `pytest -k test_examples --regenerate-screenshots`

If CI fails on screenshot verification, the build will regenerate screenshots and make them available as
build artifacts so you can download and inspect the differences, and debug locally.
