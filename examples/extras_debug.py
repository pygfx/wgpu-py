"""
Basic example of how to use wgpu-native instance extras to enable debug symbols and labels in the shader compiler.
As debugger we will use RenderDoc (https://renderdoc.org/) - other tools will require a similar setup.
While RenderDoc doesn't fully support WebGPU - it can still be useful for inspecting the render pipeline.
RenderDoc also doesn't support WGSL, so it will work off the naga translated shaders for debug stepping and editing.
Using DX12 (HLSL) or OpenGL (GLSL) gives a better decompilation experience compared to Vulkan (SPIR-V).
The Vulkan research structure most closely matches WebGPU.
