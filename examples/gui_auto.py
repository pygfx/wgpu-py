"""
Run the triangle example in an automatically selected GUI backend.

The rendercanvas automatically selects one of its available
GUI backends. E.g. running this in a notebook will use the
Jupyter backend. If the Qt event loop is running, it will use the
Qt backend. The default backend uses glfw.

See https://rendercanvas.readthedocs.io/stable/backends.html for more info,
and https://rendercanvas.readthedocs.io/stable/gallery/index.html for examples
with various GUI's and event loops.
