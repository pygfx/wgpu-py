    A ``GPUPromise`` is a bit like an ``asyncio.Future``, but specific for wgpu, and with
    an API more similar to JavaScript's ``Promise``.

    Some methods of the wgpu API are asynchronous. They return a ``GPUPromise``,
    which provides a few different ways handle it:

    * It can be awaited using ``await future``. This is the "cleanest" way, but
      can only be used from a co-routine (i.e. an async code path).
    * A callback can be registered using ``future.then(callback)``, which will
      be called when the future resolves.
    * You can sync-wait for it, using ``future.wait()``. This is simple, but
      makes code less portable and potentially slower.

    A ``GPUPromise`` is in one of these states:

    * pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    * fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    * rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
